** This sample macro shows how to customise user interface elements  **
** depending on file type.                                           **
**                                                                   **
** As a proof of concept, the PREFIX and the NUMBER commands have    **
** been implemented to be effective on "view" level, which           **
** currently looks like to be effective on "file" level.             **
**                                                                   **
** Named PROFILER EE, this macro is a repeatable profile which       **
** is called by EE after a file has been loaded into storage.        **
**                                                                   **
