EE-PREFX                                                  EE prefix subcommands

EE supports the following (case insensitive) commands in the prefix area:

 /        set this line to the current line

 .c       set the line mark 'c' on this line, replacing a possible existing
          mark with the same name;
          line mark names consist of a single letter A .. Z, so up to 26 line
          marks can be defined per file in an EE session.

 @        ignore and discard modifications made to this line in the file area
          on the screen

 I[n]     insert an empty line after this line; if the optional
          repetition-count n is given, n lines will be inserted

 D[n]     delete this line; if the optional repetition-count n is given, up
          to n lines will be deleted, but deleting at most the lines up to
          (before) the next prefix command on the screen

 DD       mark one of the boundaries of a line block to be deleted

 "[n]     duplicate this line; if the optional repetition-count n is given,
          the block of n lines (including the line with the prefix command)
          will be duplicated

 ""       mark one of the boundaries of a line block to be duplicated

 *[n]     duplicate this line; if the optional repetition-count n is given,
          this line is duplicated n times (i.e. repeated n times)

 <[n][o]  shift this line to the left (see below for the optional parameters)

 <<[n][o] mark one of the boundaries of a line block to be shifted to the left
          (see below for the optional parameters)

 <[n][o]  shift this line to the right
          (see below for optional parameters)

 >>[n][o] mark one of the boundaries of a line block to be shifted to the right
          (see below for optional parameters)

 M        move this (single) line to the target specified by either a F or a P
          prefix command

 MM       mark one of the boundaries of a line block to be moved to the target
          specified by either a F or a P prefix command

 C        move this (single) line to the target specified by either a F or a P
          prefix command

 CC       mark one of the boundaries of a line block to be copied to the target
          specified by either a F or a P prefix command

 F        place the line(s) to copy or move after (following) this line

 P        place the line(s) to copy or move before (preceding) this line

The optional repetition-count n for the prefix commands I  D  "  and * can
take the values 1..9999.

The shifting prefix commands support the following optional parameters (which
can be specified on any of the boundaries for block shifting prefix commands):

  n : the number of character positions to shift by. This must be a single
      digit from 1 to 9, with the default specified with the SHIFTCONFig
      command if n is not specified.

  o : the shiftmode for handling shifting beyond the left or right file border,
      overriding the default given with the SHIFTCONFig command. This must be
      one of the following characters identifying one of the shiftmodes (see
      the command SHIFTCONFig in: EE-CONFG):
        ?  ->  CHECKall
        :  ->  MINimal
        #  ->  LIMit
        !  ->  TRUNCate

If a line block needing a target position (MM .. MM or CC .. CC) is not
specified at once on the same screen, the target position (F or P) must be
specified after both boundaries of the block are selected (or together with
the second boundary). If the block is defined but the target is not, the
selected block (both the prefix and the file zones) will be made read-only
until the command is finalized by giving the target.

Prefix move and copy operations can be performed between files edited in EE by
specifying the source (M, C, MM .. CC or CC .. CC) and target (F resp. P) of
the operation in different files (see RINGNext / RINGPrev in: EE-FILES).

As long as prefix commands do not conflict, more than one single line command
and possibly one line range command can be issued on one screen input. Single
line commands are processed before a possibly given block command and target
position.

If EE cannot ensure a meaningful execution, all prefix commands on the screen
are ignored and removed.

After executing prefix commands, EE will try to place the cursor at a
meaningful place in the file area. The placement line depends on the prefix
command (e.g. the line inserted with the I-prefix command, but the line after
the deletion for D/DD-operation). If this line is displayed on the screen, the
cursor will be placed at the current indentation (of the last previous
non-blank line) for the I-command resp. on the first non-blank character of
the line. If the line for the cursor placement is not visible (for example a
prefix command was entered but the file content was also scrolled with a PF
key), the cursor is placed at the command prompt. If more than one prefix
command is given, the cursor is placed by the first (top most) command.
